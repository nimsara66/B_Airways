For one scheduled tour, only one seat is booked for one passport/one customer.
	You cannot book seats for others when loggin into your account. 
	If you want to book seats for someone else, log out and fill their details and book.
	
"Seat booking created" in the question denotes the booking of the seat. In this implementation it is changing the
	seat booking state to occupiend. (Inseting seat booking happened when creating the schedule.)
	This approach is selected because one sql is executing when customer is selectcting seats. If seat booking is
		set to create when selecting seats, there will be at least two sqls. Therefore, this is much more
		customer satisfactory. It is true there is a delay at staff when cretaing a schedule, but it is better than 
		delaying the customer.
